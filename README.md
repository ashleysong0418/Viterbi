# Viterbi

## Overview: 
This project aims to use the Viterbi algorithm to "train" a program to predict when words are nouns, adjectives, and so on. 
The Hidden Markov Model is one of the key concepts used in the development of this program. 

After having "trained" the program with example inputs and their matching lexical/functional grammatical class, the program
outputs data that matches any input string with each word's grammatical class. 

### Example Outputs:
